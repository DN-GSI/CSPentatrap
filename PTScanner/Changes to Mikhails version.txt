All changes to Mikhails version

- pressing the cross in the upper right corner hides now the window and does not destroy the object anYmore
- centered window
- publishes new services which indicate the Set-values of the current scan step
- Included the default settings path in the panel (1st case)
- Modified "check add object.vi" so that it is possible to scan different channels of the same PS
- publishes two new services indicating Min and Max value of the first dimension of a scan
- publishes number of scanned dimensions and maxdimensions
- Option to open or close front panel at startup
- Included "Update Objects button in edit object dialog". The reason is that the object list is not loaded automatically during the startup
